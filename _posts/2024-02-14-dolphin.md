excerpt: "From phosphorescent torpedo-run arrivals in the night to pods that stayed with us for half an hour — the Atlantic was generous with its dolphin, and we were lucky enough to witness every one."

Dolphin and more dolphin…

We were lucky in the summer, before getting onboard Zipper, in that we saw lots of dolphin when we sailed across the Channel in Coriander. We assumed that might be our lot for the season.

We needn't have feared…

Leaving Roscoff for the Canaries we saw dolphin at least once a day for most of the passage. Tom was even nervous one evening that a Russian tanker nearby had taken to torpedoing us, as the incoming night-time dolphin lit up with phosphorescence on their speedy approach straight at our midships. What a sight!

The dolphin didn't let up on our departure from the Canaries either, again we saw them at least once every day for the first few days. They then saw us out of Mindelo after we stopped in the Cape Verdes. We did lose them after that however, it seems they prefer the waters on either side of the Atlantic to the mid-Atlantic; we saw none for about 10 days in the middle, before a welcoming party greeted us a couple of days out from Barbados. With so many stories of doom, gloom and pending extinction in everything we read these days, it has been heartening to witness so many wonderful dolphin in the Atlantic waters.

Some of the pods stayed with us for half an hour or more, whilst others just came to say hi briefly. What a privilege! We did take some snaps, however they never quite do it justice. They may just help us jog our memories though…

This guy was particularly enthusiastic in his approach to catch us up from astern:
