excerpt: "We broke the boat and couldn't leave Spain — which meant five trips to the police station, a 58-euro taxi, a mobile printer, and one of the more memorable bureaucratic adventures of our lives."

In summary — we got a 1 month extension to our 90-day Schengen stay from the Spanish police in Arrecife, Lanzarote (stamped into our passports, valid for Spain). It took us about two weeks, 5 trips to the police station, 2 trips to the photocopiers and 2 (successful) trips to the bank (several unsuccessful ones).

Having spent around two months preparing Zipper in Northern France before heading South (from October and November, with an earlier trip before she went afloat in September) we had about a month left before we needed to be out of the Schengen zone. Our plan was to get to the Canaries in a couple of weeks and then head onwards relatively quickly from there; either South to the Cape Verdes, or across the Atlantic to the Caribbean. This depended on a relatively quick turnaround in the Canaries.

## The Problem?

We broke the boat, and it was going to take time to fix.

We suffered a major structural failure on our passage to the Canaries; luckily we were not too far away, around 200Nm North of Lanzarote. Having secured the rig temporarily we managed to get there without any further damage. However, Zipper was not seaworthy, we could not consider sailing (or motoring) any further without fixing the problem.

The forestay attaches, and pulls up, in the middle of the beam. This is resisted by the A frame struts, held in compression against the beam by a cable. Our problem was that the frame rotated forwards, breaking the welds between themselves and the beam. With the frame out of alignment the forestay could simply fold the beam upwards in the middle. For the remainder of the passage we secured the mast with halyards directly to the bow of each hull, and secured the frame in position by pulling it backwards with purchases to the mast.

Unfortunately it seemed that the problem was going to take a long time to fix, certainly the 2-3 weeks we had remaining on our 90 days was very unlikely to be sufficient — the companies we had been recommended were too busy to even come and look until late in January, and the recommended fix required a part with an estimated lead time of 10 weeks to manufacture, 3 weeks to ship and 2 weeks to fit. We were unable to leave, yet not allowed to stay.

## Schengen allowance – which authority?

We had to investigate whether it was possible to extend our Schengen allowance — surely there are provisions for exceptional cases where people are unable to leave?!

We started on a long chain of phone calls, being passed around from one department to another. It took a while to even find out who we needed to talk to; we were passed around the British, Spanish and Canaries embassies and consulates, the Guardia Civil and the National Police. We had a naïve expectation early on that the advice would be correct when we were told to contact another authority. In hindsight if we had written down those early calls I think we would have found that we were being passed back and forth to authorities we'd already approached before we realised it.

These calls were spread over a few days, it wasn't a case of a morning on the phone — phone calls went unanswered, opening hours varied (the siesta was frustrating, and different times for different organisations!) and on top of that we had arrived on a Saturday evening and the following week had two public holidays in it in Spain, with many people not working at all that week.

We concluded that we had to turn up somewhere in person. We were relatively confident that it was the Policia Nacional we needed to see, even though they had told us on the phone to go to the Guardia Civil.

## Island travel

We were in Marina Rubicon, right at the South of the island, because the other marinas were full and couldn't give us a berth. Unfortunately this is a long way from Arrecife, the capital and where the National Police are based. So we determined to hire a car and drive up; but, it turns out the hire car offices had shut shortly after 1100 that day (closing times appear to be based on staff preference on the day) and weren't opening again until 1630, by which time we'd definitely be too late. In a mixture of panic and frustration we got in a taxi before lunch — a one-way ride to Arrecife, less than 45mins drive, cost us 58Eu. In context that's nearly double the advertised daily rate for a hire car. We were going to have to get back too, but we left that as a problem to deal with later.

## Humanitarian case

After a couple of hours in the police station we did manage to see someone who spoke very good English, and was very helpful. He confirmed to us that we would have to be applying for an extension on humanitarian grounds, i.e. that it was unsafe or otherwise not possible for us to return home. The practicalities of having to leave the boat in Lanzarote, where there was no space in the marinas, and hoping it would magically get fixed in our absence, was not something that we were enthralled about. On the other hand, with war in Europe among other atrocities and refugee crises we couldn't help but see the relative insignificance of our own "humanitarian" plight. We were going to need some sympathetic ears.

With a case to put before the police we set about completing the documentation — in support of our application we required bank statements proving our financial means for the extended period and proof of travel insurance coverage. With four copies of the application form to fill in, one for each of us (of course the police couldn't give us more than one), into town we went to pay for photocopies, before getting the bus back to Playa Blanca — a half hour wait, 1hr45min journey (much more than we had expected!), and a half hour walk from Playa Blanca to Marina Rubicon. Needless to say it was dark when we got in the dinghy back to Zipper! To add insult to injury our outboard wasn't working, and rowing through the marina is strictly forbidden (the engine had stopped on our way in in the morning). This meant we had to wait for the marina staff to come and tow us out of the harbour — quite how towing rudderless tenders with ropes round the engines of the marina RIBs is safer than rowing is beyond me! If they hadn't agreed to tow us we would have had to have paid a fee for the use of the marina pontoon with an engine-less (or, engine attached but engine not working) dinghy. How much that would have been we didn't find out as they fortunately agreed.

Over the weekend we completed the forms, gathered the required documentation, fixed the engine, and on the Monday hired a car (one day, lunchtime to the following lunchtime) for less than the taxi ride.

**Expired UK driving license**

Flexibility around driving to and from the police was slightly complicated by the fact my driving license had expired the previous week. Poor admin on my part for not doing it before leaving, perhaps, however renewing your driving license whilst not in the country is another intensely frustrating process. After being assured renewing online would be easy it is annoying that the backup process of renewing by paper is really not quick or easy (particularly if you're not in the country). I don't know why the online renewal failed, something to do with the digital identification check, they didn't say what the problem actually was. Having failed online (in October, I still assumed a month was plenty of time to sort it out at this stage), I needed to get the paper forms completed. However you can't download or print these, you have to go to the post office or get them sent to the address on your existing license. So, I needed to wait for the Royal Mail delivery forwarding service to send this from our house to Julia and Rob (my inlaws), to pass on to Tom to bring with him when he came out for the Biscay crossing in mid-November. Now it was clear I was going to run out of time! Then I needed to complete the forms, get some passport photos printed, and send the lot back to the UK. The remaining parts (which I'm still waiting for) I hope will involve a new license going through the delivery forwarding service, to once again come out with the next visiting crew — who knows when that will be?!

## Policia Nacional

Each arrival at the police station was started by an initial conversation with the security desk at the door. This was a complete lottery, some were helpful, one went and found an English speaker to help, and another I swear had me sitting in the waiting room with no possibility of anyone ever coming to see what it was I was actually there for. Luckily we made it through each time, with a mixture of other visitors helping translate for us, some poor use (by us) of Google translate, or simply grabbing a staff member recognised from a previous visit when they coincidentally passed near the waiting room. The main problem was that we never had appointments, we were just told to 'come back tomorrow' with the next set of forms / payments. We weren't able to ask for the right person because we found out that the police don't give out their real names, so the names we had didn't exist and therefore the security person couldn't know who it was we were there to see. Needless to say each of our five visits took about two frustrating hours.

**Best pre-trip purchase: mobile printer**

One of the most useful items amongst the mountain of Amazon deliveries in preparing for the trip was the mobile printer. It's a thermal printer so doesn't require ink, and we used it to print documents in the car, on the bus, and in the police station waiting room — each occasion proving necessary to making meaningful progress on each trip to the police station. We don't have a great scanning option for duplicating formal documents, but this printer has paid us back just on these journeys.

After the second visit, on Monday, we had more forms to complete online and print off. These had barcodes on them, against which we had to pay a fee (four times, one for each of us) for the extension. The most ridiculous part was that we were supposed to work out ourselves how much the fee should be. Having had a stab at that I then went and tried to make the payment at an ATM; but failed at every stage. The banks were closed so we gave up trying to pay on Monday, to start again first thing on Tuesday. We had at least worked out we didn't need all four of us to go to the police station, so Sophie was going to return on Tuesday (I couldn't, due to my expired driving license, so was going to stay in Rubicon with the children). We had to hope we could get the payments first thing on Tuesday, in Playa Blanca, for Sophie to get to the station, in and out, and back to Marina Rubicon to return the car before midday.

**Payment by bar code**

A clever system, when it works. The idea is you scan the bar code at an ATM and it knows who the recipient is and how much to pay, and can transfer the money direct from your account.

However, there are some fields to fill in. One of which is a Spanish ID field, and this had us scuppered on the Monday. It turns out that you don't need one, you can just put "999999999" in the field — however, even once we had worked this out with the help of a bank clerk on Tuesday morning the payment failed anyway — no explanation as to why. Fortunately, they were able to process the payments for us in the bank — although rather than making payment by card we had to return to the ATM to take out cash for making the payment (with an extortionate fee of 7Eu).

## Third trip

Sophie's trip was very successful, the second set of documents were sufficient for the application and the payments had been accepted. We were now waiting to hear the ruling as to whether the extension would be granted. How long that would take we had no idea.

## Final judgement

As it turned out we had a phone call back the next afternoon; Wednesday, confirming the extension and asking us to return the next day with our passports. Not wanting to spend money on another car I set off early in the morning on a round trip by bus. I had a long wait, but finally spoke with some very accomplished English speakers who let me know that they were keeping our passports and I had to return again tomorrow. Also, that the payments I had made were not enough, so I had to now make some more. This was annoying, and I'm not even sure how they calculated the figure (it was handed to me as simply as a number hand written on a scrap paper; not exactly an invoice justifying the breakdown of the amount). Anyway, I had something to do on the bus — create more online documents with bar codes, print them (thankfully I'd brought the mobile printer), and go back to the bank to get them paid. I walked into the bank and saw the same man who had helped before — but he told me that the bank can only make payments before 1100. Really?!? Wow. I knew the answer but thought I'd try again at the ATM anyway, but of course that was just a waste of some more time. I was going to have to come back here on my way into the police station for what we really hoped would be the final trip on Friday.

## Schengen extension

The last trip to the police station (another early morning bus round-trip) was the most painful, I couldn't even get the security lady to understand that they had our passports in their office and I was there (I hoped) to collect them. Anyway, when all was said and done, I left with four passports stamped with permission to remain in Spain until the end of January.

Stamped passports all round

The date was the end of January because that was what we had paid for. It would have been possible to have extended for longer, up to an additional 90 days (which would have been late March for us). Through all of this we did learn that they are not particularly strict on the exact 90-day rule; they are not trying to catch people out, their opinion is that there are more important things to be spending police time doing. However as we knew that we were going to be more than a few days over we did need to go through the formal process.
