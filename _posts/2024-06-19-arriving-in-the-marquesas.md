The passage to the Marquesas was just over 2,000 miles for us, despite the stopover in the Galapagos which substantially shortens the distance from Panama by ~900 miles. We headed to Atuona on Hiva Oa, one of the two official check-in ports.

## The Bureaucracy

The regulations in French Polynesia dictate that everyone (all non-EU folk — thank you Brexit for another added complication) must prove their financial means to return home. There are basically two ways of doing this. The most common is to show the booking for a return flight. However when you arrive by yacht — and in all but the most unlikely scenarios are going to also leave by yacht — you don't have a plane ticket to show.

The other is to pay a bond, transferring the money that the flight would cost, which is then refundable when you leave. Neither option is attractive. After some research we found the most common workaround — buy plane tickets and then cancel them a couple of days later. Indeed there are companies out there who make their entire business out of doing this, which proves how farcical the whole situation is. You pay a relatively small fee for them to book and cancel your plane tickets for you. In the interim period you are the holder of real tickets, so any officials looking up your booking reference will find them.

## Arrival

We arrived early on Saturday 15th June and headed into town to check in before the Gendarmerie closed for the afternoon. A kind lady spotted us walking with the children and stopped to drive us into town (it's about a half hour walk, and it was getting hot mid-morning). We found everyone to be extremely welcoming and friendly.

We spent the rest of the morning exploring the town by foot — getting cash, buying SIM cards, some basic provisions at a surprisingly well-stocked small supermarket, and then trying to find somewhere for lunch. We were failing on the latter until Bumpy spotted a restaurant that was open (a bit fancier than we were initially looking for, but beggars can't be choosers). It felt like it took most of the afternoon to be served, but we weren't in a rush and enjoyed the solid chairs resting very stably on terra firma.

## Exploring Hiva Oa

With lots to explore in the Marquesas we didn't plan to stay in Hiva Oa for long. Bumpy very kindly treated us to a drive around the island before we left, visiting a historic archaeological site in the North East. The scenery was spectacular — winding roads rising through densely forested lush green cliffs, before falling away on dry and arid switchbacks on the North shore. A completely different perspective to the one we experience from the boat.

All in all a great few days to start our experience of the Marquesas.
