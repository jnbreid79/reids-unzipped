A quick stop in Bequia, snorkel and meet up with Time Bandit

We woke up early to sail across to Bequia from St Lucia and hopefully get in before dark, we have a nasty habit of arriving just after sunset, and we're keen to change that.

The forecast was perfect — 15 knots of wind from behind. We started off with exactly that, great start to the day, but it shut down within an hour, we had 2 knots. Sad times on board as the engine went on and two big Lagoons shot past us with their bigger engines. Our consolation prize was a sighting of a pod of dolphins, which is always such a pleasure and a privilege to see.

Thankfully the wind filled in again and we were flying along, and hit our highest speed yet — 14.5 knots — and soon overtook those pesky Lagoons! More dolphins came to join the celebrations briefly. Before the wind shut off again just behind St Vincent — navigation naivety, trusting the routing software and sailing downwind of a tall volcanic island! — but soon picked up again and we were in Bequia well before dark with enough time to find our preferred spot in the anchorage.

Port Elizabeth is a beautiful, colourful Caribbean town with a warm, friendly atmosphere and we enjoyed a couple of days here, snorkelling and making new friends.

We met fellow OCC members Stuart and Anne Letton in their Outremer 51, Time Bandit. They have spent several years cruising and welcomed us warmly and with amazing things to occupy the children — a Happy Horses sticker book and Geosticks. The children loved the Geosticks so much that Ann kindly lent them to us for the remainder of our stay. And when Stuart and Ann came for a drink on Zipper later that day, the children were still playing with them. Having seen the children enjoying them so much, Stuart and Ann very generously gave the children the Geosticks to keep, and they've been playing with them ever since!

We could easily have spent a lot more time in Bequia, but having made the decision to go through the Panama Canal we needed to keep moving and had heard that [Tobago Cays](https://jnbreid7.wordpress.com/2024/04/06/tobago-cays/) was somewhere not to miss!
