Glorious few days in St. Lucia!

We set off from St Anne with the prospect of a motor across to Rodney Bay, St Lucia. The forecast was for very little wind, but after 5 weeks it was high time to move on! It turned out to be one of the most glorious sails we've had on Zipper. We made the 22 mile journey in 3 hours with 8-10 knots of wind, beautiful sunshine, diving boobies and we caught a tuna for supper!

Isla loves fresh fish, particularly ceviche!

We got in to Rodney Bay just in time to for Jamie to check us in without incurring $300 overtime fees — the couple behind us were too late! But they were checking out so decided to go anyway without.

After a night in Rodney Bay we headed south, thoughts of heading to either Castries, Marigot Bay or Soufriere. I'd been to Marigot Bay when I was here 20 years ago, then it was a beautiful, idyllic, secluded anchorage with just a small shack of a bar ashore. We'd already decided to head further south than Castries, but when we saw Marigot Bay we decided just to keep going. There is now a huge hotel complex, many other building and lots of boats, not really idyllic any more — or at least not for us.

So Soufriere it was! We arrived having had another wonderful sail and were met by Malcolm, one of the boat guys, who we'd called to arrange a mooring buoy. We then had an awesome afternoon snorkelling and a stunning sunset, complete with rum punches to celebrate finally being on the move again!

We decided to explore inland a bit and the next morning Malcolm was back to take us to the tourist areas of Soufriere. We went to the mud baths — which Jamie and I enjoyed but Isla declared too smelly (the sulphur was everywhere!) and Angus didn't like because the water was too hot. But they tolerated it for long enough for Jamie and I to get muddy and exfoliated, my skin felt amazing afterwards. Then we went to the warm waterfalls. A couple of small waterfalls with three pools. Just us and another Canadian family there, we really enjoyed relaxing and enjoying the water in the rainforest. Finally we visited the 'power shower' cold waterfall. We arrived with a minibus full of other tourists and were quickly scooped up by their guide who loved Jamie and Angus's hair and she was completely smitten with them.

Then it was back to Zipper and round the headland to spend the night sleeping between the Pitons before heading to our next destination.

Sailing and exploring really does make everyone onboard happy.
