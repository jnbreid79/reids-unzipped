What an amazing month we've had in the most spectacular coral atolls — the Tuamotus, in the middle of the Pacific!

The Tuamotus are mostly about what's going on under the water, so "highlights" from above is a bit of a misnomer really. But you'll get the gist. What's going on underwater is something else entirely — see our posts on Fakarava, Kauehi and Tahanea for that.
