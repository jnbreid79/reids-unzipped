To go, or not to go? That was our question.

In hindsight this feels a little like the disruptive outcome of a political vote. You can keep on asking yourself the same question, and the incumbent only needs to lose once for the status-quo to be overturned. So, "go" was therefore inevitable?

Well yes and no. We did ask ourselves the question a lot, however the answer was pretty much always "go". We realised the real question we were asking ourselves was "when shall we go?".

The main factor in "when" is the age of the children; 2023 has been our target for a while with Angus old enough to remember it (and hopefully learn something from it?!) and Isla young enough to go back into primary school when we return (not going straight into secondary school).

Having made the decision to become liveaboards the rest would be easy, surely? Well, some parts definitely yes, thanks mostly to a lot of wonderful people and enormously supportive families, friends and neighbours. However the 7 months it's taken to get onboard have been pretty stressful at times, lots of times, and I think it's fair to say it's been harder work than we'd ever imagined!
