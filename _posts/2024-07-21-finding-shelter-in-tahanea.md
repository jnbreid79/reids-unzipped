Picture postcard perfect! The Tuamotus have been the place that we've wanted to get to the most — crystal clear waters, beautiful corals, more seaside than you can imagine.

Raroia was the perfect introduction. It was absolutely idyllic — having an anchorage to ourselves was what we had been dreaming of. It did last only the first night, but one of the other boats that joined us was our friends on Eleuthera, whom we had met in Anaho on Nuku Hiva.

Barb makes a mean banana cake (with icing!) and Angus and Isla were thrilled to see them again. We watched SailGP on Eleuthera (astonishing what you can do with Starlink these days...) then decided to head to Tahanea while Eleuthera had to head to Fakarava to pick up guests.

## Passage

The going was not good. Winds were much lighter than forecast and at 6:30pm we put the engines on and gave up hope of the morning pass. But by midnight there was more breeze, so off the engines went and suddenly we were flying along again under sail. A fast night meant we made it into Tahanea easily on the morning slack after all.

We tucked round with some protection between the central and West passes and dropped the anchor, had breakfast, then hotfooted it to the north pass for some snorkelling — it didn't disappoint!

## Snorkelling the Pass

The coral was incredible! And there were a huge number of fish too. We dinghied out several times to drift back in on the current. We've read a lot about coral bleaching — and in many places the condition is not what it used to be — but it really couldn't be much better in the places we've been.

In the afternoon there was exploring of the nearest motu to be done. A coconut shy was quickly set up and two coconuts harvested for Zipper — the latest gadget for this is a sharp knife tied to the end of the boat hook. This has the advantage that you only need to make it halfway up the coconut tree trunk, but also the disadvantage that you have to cling onto the tree whilst holding quite a dangerous weapon.

The next morning we managed to sneak outside the pass and experienced the huge corals and pelagic fish — as well as a few sharks and, amazingly, a manta ray right in the middle of the pass. What a sight!

## A Weather Front

We then headed across the atoll ahead of a front, seeking shelter from the West and South with the wind expected to swing a full 360 degrees. This has been a bit of a feature of our time in French Polynesia — several fronts have come through with strong winds and big shifts. For this one we hid behind the "7" reef and were nicely protected from the Westerly.

After the weather settled we were back to a strong Easterly trade wind, so we spent another day up in the North and snorkelled the central pass as well as the West one. This pass was also excellent, with more and bigger sharks keeping us on our toes. A shame we didn't make it to the East pass, but the wind didn't comply this time — and the other two were great anyway!
