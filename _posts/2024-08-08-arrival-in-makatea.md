Wowsers, what a place this is!!!

We were just starting to feel a bit sad as we approached the island. It is an island — not an atoll — and as we could see it growing in the distance it firmly marked the end of our time in the Tuamotus proper. We know there is a lot more to see as we head further West and we are excited about that, however the Tuamotus really are somewhere special and in some ways perhaps our minds had cast them as the highlight of the whole trip.

But we needn't have worried. Makatea really is spectacular! The coastline is extraordinary — sheer cliffs with large overhangs cut out by the force of the ocean. As we rounded the Northern shore a coral ledge edged into view, and we had our fingers firmly crossed as we counted the number of masts. There are four buoys here, and no anchoring options. Counting 4 masts we were anxious, however as we got closer it was clear that two were on the same yacht — one was a ketch — so we knew there was one buoy available.

It was only in 2018 that the buoys were installed on the edge of the reef. Prior to that it hadn't been possible to visit Makatea, so it really is a very recent addition to the cruising route. And what an amazing addition it is!

As we headed up to drop the mainsail Sophie spotted two humpback whales breaching ahead of us, perhaps a little over a mile away. Enormous plumes of spray shot up, so we stayed watching the show for a while as they slapped their pectorals and tails between their occasional breaches. Wow! We had heard whale season had started in the leeward islands, but we weren't expecting any here. What an incredible welcome!

## The Mooring

Now we just needed to find the free buoy. Picking it up really *did* feel close to the reef — Pacific swell crashing onto the reef a mere couple of boat lengths away. The warp itself didn't have a metal eye in it and was a little frayed in parts, so we weren't filled with confidence. After diving in to investigate further, the chain comes all the way up to a couple of metres below the surface — so we put our anchor bridle directly down onto that and felt very secure. Well, as long as the wind doesn't go West...

The proximity is understandable — just a further boat length offshore and the depth is, as far as our instruments can determine, infinite. The coral wall simply falls into the abyss. The water is crystal clear, this feels very like mooring in Bonaire but with a more extreme drop-off.

Tapu, the mayor's son whom we had a WhatsApp chat with a few days earlier, came down to the harbour to welcome us. He hailed us on VHF16 and we went into the harbour in the dinghy to meet him. His English is excellent, and with a tour around the island to look forward to tomorrow we are very excited.

The next morning, after moving South to a buoy slightly further from the reef:
