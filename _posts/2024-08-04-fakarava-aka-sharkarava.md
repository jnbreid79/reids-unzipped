Zipper in Fakarava, including the South Pass — sharks, sharks and more sharks!

## Arrival, Anchoring and Re-Anchoring

We timed our entry into the south pass from Kauehi based on the forecasted wind. Of course the wind dropped on our way and we arrived at the Fakarava South pass at max current with the sun beginning to set. Although this was very picturesque, it was far from ideal for getting in and anchored safely!

The pass looked relatively benign, so we decided to go through rather than wait all night outside. Jamie helmed through this one — it's long, narrow and very shallow if you choose to take the shortcut. In the event the pass was fine, but we overshot the biggest sandy patch around by about 5 metres. Damn, so close!

Jamie jumped in the water and with our trusty anchor team of Isla and Angus ready on the bow, Sophie took the helm. With Jamie directing operations in the water we managed to untangle ourselves and reset the anchor in the sandy patch. Phew!

## Snorkelling the South Pass

Then it was time to explore. The coral was wonderful and the fish were plentiful and huge! We also spotted a few sharks hanging out — we've heard they like it here.

Back to the boat for lunch before returning to the pass for the afternoon tide. We drifted out all the way from the coral garden, grabbed a handily placed buoy to hang out and relax for half an hour, then jumped back in to drift back into the pass on the incoming current. Amazing — a fantastic snorkel for everyone with sharks everywhere. The water was pristine, if a little chilly — we seem to have become too acclimatised to the tropics!

## Diving the South Pass

We obviously wanted to dive the South pass. We decided we had to join a guided dive — we weren't going to leave without diving the pass!

Sophie went on one day leaving Jamie to ponder the problem of the broken gear cable — with a promise that he could dive the next day if he managed to create a usable workaround. Sophie had two amazing dives, and on returning was impressed to find the children doing school work and Jamie making progress in the engine room. A jury system manually rigged up, sufficient to get us to Tahiti — Jamie was allowed his dive the next day!

The company we dived with was Enata Diving, and they really were excellent. Each was a two-dive trip, different from each other — catching the end of the ebb and then the start of the flood. Going early also meant there were no other tour boats out, so we had the pass to our small group of 5 each day.

> We wouldn't have found the "shark television" spot if we'd dived on our own. This is a cave/overhang where we just lay flat and held on for ~10 minutes watching literally hundreds of sharks right in front of us. There were over 500 shark in the pass both days.

## Rotoava and the North Pass

After Jamie got back from his dive we headed up to the North, arriving in time to see where we were anchoring and get settled for the night. We had a gorgeous sail through the atoll, managing to avoid bommies and pearl farm floats.

The next morning we headed into town — by far the biggest town we've seen for a while, with the most beautifully decorated church covered with exquisite hand-made shell chandeliers and decorations. We provisioned at two shops, even managing to find eggs and some fresh fruit and vegetables. What a luxury!

On Sunday morning we saw a couple of boats head out of the pass ahead of us. It looked a bit rough so we waited an hour — and it couldn't have been more straightforward. As we started going through, 4 dive boats also went through; a sure sign we had timed it perfectly for the slack!

Fakarava was incredible and we were all really sad to leave. Luckily Toau didn't disappoint…
