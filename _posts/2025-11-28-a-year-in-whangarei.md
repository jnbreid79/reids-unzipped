An unplanned year in Whangarei! During a year working and at school we've dealt with a stroke, skin cancer and now a broken arm — we feel we've tested the NZ health service sufficiently, so it's time to go sailing again. It's also been a blast, between times!

So, that's a year then! I think we did at least tell you we were stopping for a bit and wouldn't be posting any updates, but we had expected to sail back North from New Zealand at the start of May.

So, what happened?!

Well, we've had some ups and downs, but through all of that we've had an amazing time and all four of us have loved it here! Isla and Angus have now been in Whangarei Primary for more than a year (they started in mid-November last year), and have absolutely excelled. Going from a school of 80 in total at Itchen Abbas to over 500 pupils in the same primary school age bracket here — and a year cooped up with their parents with Grandparent rotations in between — it's fair to say it's a completely different experience. They have done what they do and thrown all of themselves into it, and are thriving as a result. The hardest part now is that we've been here too long in some respects; they've had enough time to really make friends and start to feel more settled. Emotional times as this term comes to an end and we prepare to finally stow the mooring lines and put the anchor back to work.

We'll try and write a bit more another time, but here's an abridged version in the meantime…

## The Stroke

Today, 27th November, is a date we'll always remember. One year ago today I had recently started back at work, I was walking back to the boat to meet Sophie for lunch. In the middle of Whangarei, waiting at a pedestrian crossing, I started to feel odd — numbness like a dental block on my left jaw — and relatively quickly deteriorated with a mixture of tingling and numbness. Slowly enough that I could call Sophie, but quickly enough that I knew something was seriously wrong. I was pretty confident that these were the symptoms of a stroke. I sent a pin with my location to Sophie at 13:00, and at 14:00 I was in a CT scanner at the hospital here in Whangarei. That's not an hour of my life I want to go through again — the most extraordinary part of it was being completely mentally aware of what was happening, but completely losing the ability to control my body. At times I had complete paralysis down my left side, no movement at all in my left arm or leg, and unintelligible garbled speech.

The service to get me from the street into a CT scanner and the care of a specialist stroke consultant within an hour was outstanding. There are not many places in the world where that would happen, so although I might be a little aggrieved to have had a stroke, I was seriously lucky that we had just arrived here. I can't imagine what it would have been like at sea. Fortunately, my symptoms resolved themselves naturally whilst I was in the scanner; by the time I was back on the ward I was able to talk properly again, and my limbs were behaving when asked to move. This was a relief, to say the least!

After some recovery and a few tests it was confirmed I needed a heart op, which I had in Auckland in April. The hardest part for me had been getting my head around why and how this had happened when I was about as fit and healthy as I've ever been.

I'm sure you can see why we chose not to tackle the ocean crossing back up to the tropics in May! Instead, as these types of sailing adventures are dictated by annual hurricane/cyclone seasons, our choices were to sell up and head home, or to add a year. Tempting as it was to come home we really weren't ready to throw it all in yet. So, with support all round — for which we'll eternally be grateful — it was school and work through the rest of 2025 so we can get back on the water in 2026.

## Sophie's Turn

Unfortunately, it seems Sophie didn't want to miss out! Almost immediately after my op she was diagnosed with a skin cancer (fortunately a BCC, so not spread) on the side of her nose. What can often be a relatively simple operation turned into a complicated procedure as it was both deep and conspicuous, with scars extending from her eyebrow down to the side of her mouth. They are extremely vigilant on skin cancers here in NZ as they are sadly very common, and are therefore very experienced in treating them.

The most frustrating thing is that this was a mole Sophie had had for years — not one she'd picked up in our year sailing the tropics as you might have imagined. She's very careful all the time and had already had this particular mole checked out not once, not twice, but three times back in the UK. Disappointingly, the response she received was pretty much: stop being so vain, it's just a mole. We can't help but feel it would have been substantially less invasive to remove a few years ago.

But anyway, it's off now, Sophie has pretty much rebuilt her muscle movement and is working on improving her sensation further. She has one more trip to the surgeon in Auckland before her "nose job" is complete. A lesson for us all though — if you're not already, you should learn to be a smiler. Sophie's smile creases have been perfect for hiding her scars!

## Angus Joins the Club

And then, just as we thought we'd tested the New Zealand health service enough, Angus wanted in — breaking his arm at the first cricket practice of the year. Although it was obviously pretty painful at the time, it was fortunately a greenstick and not a bad fracture, so we're still hoping our plan for a pre-Christmas departure from Whangarei is on. His cast came off this week!

## And Isla

Finally, just in case she gets any ideas, we're considering locking Isla in her cabin until we get out of New Zealand waters. But it wouldn't be fair if we didn't put her in here too — the girl keeping the whole show on the road, who turned 10 last week!

So there you have it — a bit of a tumultuous year that we will be pleased to put behind us. But it hasn't all been bad; we have made some incredible friends and have really enjoyed our stay in Whangarei. It's time to get back to what we love and start sailing and exploring again.
