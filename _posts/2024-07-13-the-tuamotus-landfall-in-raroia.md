I (Jamie) had visited Raroia as our first atoll when I sailed to the Tuamotus 12 years ago on Mystic. I have been trying to come up with a different route this time — after all there are loads of atolls, surely we can see different ones?! But after lots of umm'ing and ahh'ing, landfall in Raroia just makes sense. Heading to an atoll further West was not attractive: we'd have fewer options afterwards without sailing back upwind, and generally the Western atolls are more visited and a little less remote.

After an easy pass we had a swim, and despite floating the chain we wrapped our first coral head. Although a bit annoying to have messed it up on anchor #1, this was a great confidence booster — we proved to ourselves that we could unwrap the chain with Jamie in the water and the children running the show on the foredeck, with Sophie on the helm.

## The Octopus

Our abiding memory of Raroia is the octopus. We were really lucky and saw several — absolutely amazing creatures. We saw them change colour, swim in the open, hide behind rocks and peek out, push shells about, and generally be all shades of awesome. Particularly when they are peeking out at you, it's hard not to wonder what they're thinking about in those intelligent brains of theirs.

## Firsts

Raroia was also the location for quite a few firsts:

**First paddle boarding for the children.** As the wind died completely we had perfect conditions and they loved it, very quickly picking up techniques reasonable enough to propel them forward on our enormous boards.

**First kitesurf of the trip.** On pumping up our 10m Airush the strut connectors had perished in the sail locker. Luckily it wasn't too windy, so it had to be the 14m Slingshot instead — but it was very gusty, and to be honest far from in control!

**First Southerly wind squall.** This one completely caught us out — our only consolation was that it seemed to have caught everyone else out too. It was the middle of the night: heavy rain and gusting 30kts from the opposite direction. A lesson — if the wind drops and backs into the North this is an indicator of a front coming, regardless of what the forecast is telling you.

**First drone flight.** Thank you Grumpy for the old drone! Keen not to put it straight in the drink first time out I wanted to launch it from land initially. Lots to learn…

## Sights

We also visited the motu where the Kon Tiki crashed, with a small monument and plaque to recognise the adventure. A few tattered flags hang from the trees behind. We took the opportunity to walk out to the reef and wonder what on earth you would do next if you did land here without perishing in the surf on the edge of the reef! It's a frighteningly remote place.

And finally, the Raroia Yacht Club — an unofficial sign hanging on a beach with some flags left by other cruisers. Bringing our own beers and beach games we had a lovely evening with the crews of Zen and Eleuthera.

After a few wonderful days it was time to move on — there are plenty of other atolls we want to explore!
