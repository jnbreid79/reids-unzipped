Marine parks, turtles and carburettors.

It's not all snorkelling with turtles and rays, diving the wrecks and paddleboarding into the marine parks whilst we're here in Barbados — although enough of it is, so here's the compulsory photo of today's turtle:

Picture taken this-afternoon snorkelling straight off the back of the boat.

We were kindly invited by family friends (thanks David, Alice and Olly!) to their home for a day ashore and a swim in their pool — freshwater, it was lovely. And lunch provided on the terrace which doesn't constantly rock around, a novelty for us these days, thank you!

## Barbados lifeguards

The lifeguards here have not been quite so accommodating. Our first encounter with them was off Holetown, we were anchored near where the tourist boats (catamarans larger than ours) come in every morning, and had anchored there with Olly onboard — he has worked on the boats for years and knows very well where we are and aren't allowed to be anchored. Anyway, the lifeguards told us we had to move in the morning as we were in the marine park. They gave us a leaflet and suggested we study it before choosing where to re-anchor, either to the North or South. They then watched us move and re-anchor, before coming up to us again after we had settled and telling us we were still in the wrong place. I'm not sure what we had done to upset them, but this was when it became clear they just didn't want us there for some reason — we were clearly outside the GPS coordinates of the park (as defined on their leaflet, we were well above the North of Zone 1), and he was making up new visual references as he was talking to us. Without much choice we begrudgingly moved again, this time the other side of an anchored yellow paddleboard which apparently now had some sort of significance in this arbitrary marine part boundary. This just made it a really long dinghy ride to get back to the beach in Holetown.

The second frustration was paddleboarding into the park and picking up a buoy to tie to whilst we snorkelled. The lifeguards ashore whistled us and made it clear we were not to stay there. Unsure why this was I decided to go closer and try to have a chat with them. Clearly trying to get their attention this was obviously a chat they didn't want to have as they walked away and generally tried to completely ignore me; so, I decided to land on the beach and go and find them. The beach itself was red-flagged, as there was quite a swell. Anyway I finally got to speak to them, only after I climbed up the steps to their hut to join them up there — still trying to ignore me! I was told there wasn't much to see anyway as the swell was disturbing the sand, however the real reason was that they didn't want us there when they weren't letting people out from the beach under the red flags. Fair enough I suppose, although quite frustrating for those of us self-sufficient coming from the waterside. To be honest the swell has been a bit of a nuisance, since we've been here it's been a bit rocky at anchor most days, and landing on the beach has been impossible with the dinghy most days. Unfortunately this has meant we haven't had a chance to snorkel in the Folkestone marine park.

## Jobs list

It's probably not fair to blame the lifeguards, but let me try anyway… we had to use our anchor a few times more than we would otherwise, and we had to dinghy further than we would have done otherwise. What were the two jobs I've had to do in the last couple of days? Yep, the anchor windlass and the dinghy outboard… so it's obviously their fault, right?

### Anchor windlass buttons

To be honest the windlass had been starting to play up already. It's quite unnerving when your windlass suddenly starts dropping the anchor of it's own accord. It's done that a few times — either it will start dropping the anchor for real, or if restrained it will just bunch the anchor chain and jam it in the windlass on deck. So we'd taken to only turning it on immediately before using it. I also felt I'd had weak electric shocks from the deck buttons recently, not ideal either, and on the last occasion the entire nav station restarted itself at the same time. So it was definitely time to do something about it, and fortunately we had spare new deck buttons for both the Up and Down controls onboard (our wealth of spares can cater for lots of eventualities, alas not the [autopilot springs](https://jnbreid7.wordpress.com/2024/02/09/pit-stop-mindelo-cape-verde/) though). Of course these relatively small jobs take longer than you'd like, the sikaflex was on it's fifth or sixth outing and had dried up most of the way back up the tube, bouncing around in the swell under the trampoline in the dinghy made threading cables tricky, and the windlass locker where the cabling lives only allows you to put one arm or your head in at a time — you have to get good at doing jobs one-handed without looking when you live on a boat! I was very pleased when I tested the old down switch with the multimeter, the open resistance was much less than infinite and the closed resistance much more than zero (not quite the same as each other, but order of magnitude not very different) — so I could be confident this was the problem, which is always reassuring. Also the rubber button cover was split, a sign that seawater was almost certainly inside the switch where it definitely doesn't belong. Did I need to do both switches or just the Down? Yes, although not broken yet, a relatively light thumb press went straight through the rubber cover of the Up button. A good job to get done, and the anchor has since (touch wood) not taken to dropping itself.

### Carburettor

We run the outboard from an external fuel tank, and we've both several times stalled the engine by accidentally pulling out the fuel line. Initially this caused a bit of head scratching each time, but fortunately we're so used to it now it's our first check. After I serviced the engine in Lanzarote, new spark plug, new engine oil and transmission oil, it has behaved very well. So it was frustrating when it stopped working again a couple of days ago. It would start fine first time, but would then stall and rarely restart. I was out of ideas with my outboard engine knowledge; so time for Google and YouTube videos. The most frustrating part of that was getting to a place that had a good enough internet connection, my phone (Holafly e-sim) frustratingly isn't up to it here — it's nice to know you're not going to use up all your data too quickly, but it's also massively annoying to pay for something that's too slow to be useful when you need it. So it was time to move again nearby to a spot where we had found a free unlocked Wi-Fi last week.

The engine was flooding, I diagnosed that much. And YouTube persuaded me the only thing for it was to take apart the carburettor. Not something I've done before, and against my better judgement had to be done with the engine on the dinghy in the chop behind the boat. Best try hard not to drop any parts (or tools) off the back then! I do enjoy taking things like this apart and seeing how they really work. Servicing our winches in Tenerife has taught me to take more photos than you think you need to remember what bit goes where when it comes putting it back together again. So the iPhone was another necessary piece of kit to try not to drop off the back.

YouTube videos are all well and good, but they are largely all made on new kit, or by people who have just practiced it first (bit like avoiding a live software demo, as we know how they can catch you out). What this means is that the videos don't have any of the real life scenarios that make these jobs hard to do; in my case the 7-year old probably-never-been-taken-off fuel hoses were all locked solid onto their fittings. And without undoing a couple of fuel hoses (doesn't really matter which end, but one end of each needs to come off) the carburettor isn't coming out of the engine. Anyway, I decided I would just pull harder as it wasn't working anyway, and yes of course one of the fuel hoses did just break. Fortunately I was lucky, a 1cm shorter fuel hose is just about still long enough (I have a lot of spare hoses onboard, but of course not this one — something to add to the shopping list when the next opportunity arises).

So I did get to the inside of our carburettor. The float came off, the jets came out, and I looked at them all for a while whilst thinking nothing looked obviously amiss. So I prodded around with some thin wires and looked at them for a while longer, before concluding there wasn't much more I could do so had better start putting it back together before I forgot what went where; I also learned in Tenerife that relying on the photos is an option to avoid if possible.

Slightly to my surprise, back together again and the engine is running smoothly. Thank you YouTube! My guess is that we got some sand or something through the fuel system and jamming the float open, probably on one of the occasions when the fuel lead popped off and dropped into the gritty bottom of the dinghy. We can go shopping again now, so that's a job for tomorrow before checking out and preparing to sail the 100 miles over to Martinique on Wednesday.

### Zipper's skirt

We've only been here a couple of weeks, but Zipper has already grown a substantial skirt along the waterline. We're in 'low-riding' mode, carrying so much kit onboard we sit slightly below the antifouled waterline which I'm sure doesn't help. However having scrubbed her hard before leaving the Canaries it's a bit sad to have to do the same again so soon after finishing the passage.

Along with cleaning the decks this is a job we can get the children involved in. Although it's probably also slightly slower as a consequence we're playing the long game, one day the net contribution will become positive won't it?! Sophie this time has taken to the water to lead the team on the scrubbing, enabling me to concentrate on pretending to be an electrician and mechanical engineer. Great job team, Zipper's waterline is clean again, looking so much better, and presumably faster too…
