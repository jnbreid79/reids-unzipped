excerpt: "A 180-degree wind shift as a front went overhead, and our anchor didn't reset. A textbook example of a Rocna failure mode — and a lesson about bimini sides in strong winds."

We've seen quite a deep low pressure developing in the forecasts for the last week or so, travelling from West to East passing well to the South of us. This has a front extending to the North which we've been planning to shelter from in a good anchorage — our choice was the South East corner of Fakarava.

We arrived and found our anchor spot in plenty of time, with the gribs suggesting we might see gusts of 25kts as the front came through, probably with a lot of rain:

The biggest island in this weather map is Tahiti (towards the bottom left), the island group top right is the Marquesas. We are at the green marker. Nastier colours of red and bigger arrows mean more wind, with the arrows indicating direction — we were expecting a big shift very quickly from the North all the way round to South, through the West.

## The Drag

The front duly arrived at around 10am. We were anchored in 9m depth on sand, ~50m chain out, with floats at roughly 20m, 30m and 40m. This shows what happened according to our anchor alarm:

The cross in the middle is where we set the anchor. The red lines are the track of the boat. The green ring is the alarm.

**#1** — Our position overnight, anchor holding well, swinging ~30 degrees to a consistent Northerly wind.

**#2** — When the front hit us just before 10am. Wind swung immediately round towards the West, 20–25kts gusting 29. Anchor held nicely, swinging exactly as we would hope.

**#3** — A little before 1pm the wind shifted nearly all the way round to the South, still at 25kts gusting 29. And we started to drag — the track shows we didn't hold at this new angle at all.

> This is a classic example of an anchor reset failure. The Rocna holds extremely well in one direction — we've been delighted with it so far — but it has a failure mode that is beginning to be more widely known. Having read about this previously we've been on edge every time we've experienced shifting winds at anchor. Until now we've not suffered any problem.

## Re-Anchoring

We upped anchor (a little harder with 3 sets of floats to get off the chain) and got ready to reset. We got the anchor back down, further out from the lee shore, in 12m water with 60m chain and again three sets of floats.

We struggled quite a lot with keeping control, and overran the anchor chain under our port hull twice. We realised the problem — it was the bimini. In preparation for the rain we had put the sides up, and the starboard side was causing us to swing horribly.

So, another lesson learned: we won't be putting the bimini up in strong winds at anchor in the future.

*Update the following day:* It turns out it wasn't the bimini at all. The port engine was stuck in forward gear — the gear cable had sheared. So instead of idling when pulling up the chain it was driving us slowly forward. After disconnecting the cable we can now manually select forward or reverse from within the engine room. Jamie rigged up some pulleys to enable gear changes from outside — not ideal, but far better than many alternatives. Something else for the jobs list in Tahiti!
