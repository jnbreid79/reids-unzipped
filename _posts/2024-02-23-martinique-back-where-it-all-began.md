Slow passage and lobster pots

Zipper is back in Martinique. This is where we bought her in May last year. So, having had her delivered to Cherbourg in June, we have now sailed her all the way back, and here we are!

We planned our early morning departure from Barbados (2am) to give ourselves plenty of time for the 100 mile crossing to arrive in Martinique before it got dark yesterday. We remember from last year there are a lot of lobster pots, many of which are just tiny bottles or foam/polystyrene blocks (we remember this well as we caught one last year), so we wanted to navigate in the light. Of course the wind didn't get the memo, and shut off much earlier than forecast. So we had a very slow crossing and had to motor the second half.

This meant it got dark about an hour before we arrived. However as luck would have it the nearly-full moon was shining brightly, so getting in was going to be Ok. I was up on the bow looking out as we motored into the outside edge of the anchorage at Sainte Anne, and got ready to anchor in ~4m of water. As I was about to drop Sophie alerted me that the port engine was stuck in reverse, and then shortly afterwards that it had stopped running entirely. OK, we're stationary, so let's just drop the anchor first then work out what's happened. And yes, sure enough, we've caught another fishing line…

It was late and we still needed supper, so working out what's happened needed to wait until the morning. But having been serious enough to stall the engine, it wasn't a very relaxing and confident sleep.

So, first thing this morning was time to dive in and have a look. The news underneath was about as good as it could have been — the line was caught by the skeg, not wrapped on the prop, and although in the gap above the rudder didn't appear to be doing anything untoward there:

So having cleared the rope it was time to start the engine and cross our fingers. Why had it stalled, had it been damaged, would it start? Fortunately yes, it did start, and yes, it did engage both forward and reverse gears (without making any of the horrendous noises we had on M&D's Coriander when we wrapped the jib sheet around her prop and unseated the engine a couple of years ago), and we have been in and out of Le Marin today without issue. Phew!!

What caused it to stop isn't clear, I guess that the rope did foul the engine briefly, enough to upset it. We have no idea whether we had towed it for long, or whether we picked it up literally at the last minute when anchoring. My guess is we had it for a while; a line towed off the skeg feeds nicely under the prop so it's a good design in that respect. It then caused the problem when the boat stopped and we engaged reverse, at which point the rope would have been all round the prop. We'll never know though.

Lessons from this event:

- Even if you think you can see in the dark, you can't. I didn't see a single pot on our way in, even though I thought the sea was well lit by the moon. A quick scan in the morning further disproved that theory.
- If you think 2am is early enough to leave, go at midnight. Although she's a fast sailing boat Zipper has small engines, and she's slow under motor. We could probably have run both and arrived before dark, but would have cost us twice as much in diesel.
