I think it's official, we've made it, we have now joined the world of the cruising sailor. It's 9 months since we bought [the boat](https://jnbreid7.wordpress.com/the-boat/), 7 months since the children finished school last year, 5 months since I started my sabbatical and 4 months since we moved onboard. Since sailing out of Cherbourg harbour we've sailed about 5,000 miles.

However up until now we've either been trying to get somewhere we hoped to already be (the original plan wasn't to start in Northern France in November, we hoped to have already left the Canaries by then!), or trying to fix something on the boat so we can get back to trying to get to the place we already hoped to be.

So it isn't until now, a week into our stay in Barbados, having completed our Atlantic crossing, that we really feel we're settling into this way of life. Snorkelling with turtles before boat-school this-morning. Diving tomorrow. Yes, this is it!

Zipper at anchor in Barbados

We are recognising boats and people who we have seen in the Canaries and Cape Verdes. The first boat we saw on passage, Nakee off Finnistere back in November, has completely coincidentally been everywhere we have! We met in Las Palmas before Christmas and saw her again in Mindelo and now Port St. Charles last week.

What has really made it for us now though is meeting up with other sailors. Anchored next to us here in Carlisle Bay we were invited onboard Billaroo (yes, obviously an Aussie boat!) for tea yesterday. Kerry and Sue waved us over on our dinghy ride 'home' (back to Zipper) after our trip ashore. We had seen their boat, without meeting them, in Mindelo before crossing and again in Port St. Charles in the North of Barbados last week. They are now sailing as a couple, having cruised as a family of 5 years ago with their now-grown-up children. It is great, and enormously reassuring, speaking to people like them who have been there and done that with children a similar age to ours.

However just to show how small the world really is, we had the most extraordinary coincidence on the bus yesterday. There are three levels of bus in Barbados, blue (larger and less regular, but scheduled — we got one of these out of town in the morning), yellow (a bit smaller, scheduling and time tables are anyone's guess), and white minibuses (hundreds of them, stopping on demand a bit like taxis but running specific routes). We were waiting for a yellow bus back into town in the afternoon, and saw several of the minibuses pass. We declined getting on several as they were all pretty much full already, the four of us would have been a challenge (the driver and ticket guys were up for it, but having already had a pretty uncomfortable more-than-full bus journey last week we thought we'd wait this time). Then a near empty white minibus did stop and called us in, so we jumped on. Chatting to the couple already on the bus I told them our story; we are living on a boat, we'd sailed over, blah blah blah…. Unlike most people who really don't understand this, they totally got it, and of course it turned out they'd also sailed over. However, they weren't on a yacht in Barbados (which it seemed reasonable to me to assume), they had just flown into the airport from the Grenadines, slightly further South and West, where they had crossed to — and were only in Barbados as they had to stop-over getting a flight back to the UK. It also turned out that we had indeed also seen them in Mindelo before crossing, we were there at the same time and they recognised the boat and remember speaking with Sophie's parents on the pontoon! The chances of ending up on the same bus on the South coast of a busy Barbados that afternoon seem astonishingly small. Small world! But as we are learning more and more, the cruising world is a small, and very welcoming, world.
