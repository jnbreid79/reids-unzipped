Timing is everything, especially when you are dependent on the weather. The predicament for this 450Nm passage — leave too early and it will be very rough (tail end of the weather we'd been hiding from in Anaho and Hatiheu), too late and the wind would die before we got there.

Originally we thought we'd leave on Monday, but it became apparent that we'd run out of wind waiting that long. Then we thought Sunday, but in the end left at 6pm on Saturday evening, just as the sun was setting.

It was a rough first night — starting with two reefs we quickly put the third in, but with the wind on the beam we were still powering on at over 9kts which was pretty uncomfortable in the still-quite-large cross swell. So we decided to drop the main entirely and sail the rest of the night under jib, much more comfortable so we could sleep and yet still make progress at mostly 5kts.

Having just said goodbye to Bumpy it was also our first passage just the four of us since getting into Panama in the Atlantic. Sophie and I got back into the swing of our watches fairly quickly, but with those conditions this wasn't our easiest passage! A tell-tale sign of how easy we're finding a passage is by looking at how much fishing we're doing. On this one, the answer was none.

Although the wind and swell did drop off as forecast, by Monday we were caught up in horribly squally weather — wind gusting wildly overnight between 4 and 27kts, associated with shifts of 180 degrees and heavy rain showers that we didn't manage to dodge. Hard to set sails in, to say the least.

We were happy and relieved when we could see the motus of Raroia looming before us in the early hours. You have to get pretty close to a Tuamotu to see it — there is no land to speak of, so the maximum altitude is no more than the height of a palm tree. Very different from approaching the high volcanic islands in the Marquesas.

Although we had missed the early slack, our entrance into the pass was simple. We were extremely excited having officially made it to the Tuamotus and getting into our first atoll!

With hindsight we are happy that we made the right decision in leaving when we did. Boats setting off after us had to motor a lot of the passage as the wind died completely, so although it was a bit uncomfortable we were very happy not to have used any diesel.
