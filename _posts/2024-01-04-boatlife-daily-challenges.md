New jobs stopping us getting to the existing jobs list.

The jobs list is long, and it is certainly not helped by the 'new' jobs that crop up and surprise us — we could do without these ones!

For a flavour… since Christmas we are on one per day:

## Boxing day – epoxy leak

One of the hinges on our starboard (the one with the holding tank) loo seat has broken. So, time to get some epoxy mixed up to try and repair it, before spending 20Eu on the Jabsco replacement kit.

In pulling out the epoxy from the locker I found that the hardener had leaked. Yuck! How on earth this has happened I do not know, the container is huge for the amount of hardener in it, so there's no way it would be anywhere near up to the lid even if we heeled at 45 degrees (which as a catamaran, Zipper certainly hasn't done, even in the rougher weather).

Anyway, lesson learned, keep all opened containers in cockpit lockers, and bag them. And yes, I did know that already, of course I did. But I didn't do it. I do now, after quite a lot of unnecessary / self-inflicted cleaning up!!

## 27th December – gas cylinder misfits

Time to refill our gas bottles. We've seen they have the same Spanish bottles stacked outside the fuel dock in the marina, so this'll be easy, right? Wrong. Of course not! No, they can't refill or exchange our gas bottles (we have two empty Spanish ones, and one French Campingaz one to fill), we need to visit the DISA site 20km away, before 11am. Cue emergency car hire (substantially increases the cost of gas!). Fortunately they could refill the Spanish bottles for us, but not the Campingaz. Oh well, two out of three will last us many weeks, more than enough for the coming crossing.

So let's put one of the full ones in the gas locker, ready for when the existing (Italian) bottle we're currently using runs out. But what's this? Oh no, surely not, these Spanish bottles don't even fit in our gas locker!!! So the 28th was spent building a support bracket in the next door locker to securely mount one of these Spanish bottles, and feed the hose through the bulkhead. No idea how these bottles were previously used, on deck when not on passage perhaps? Presumably we've forgotten one of our handover conversations.

## 28th December – chart failure

Time to finally get sailing again, and on our way out of the harbour we realise we haven't got any detail in our charts. The onboard Raymarine plotters are only showing the very basic (and very low precision) land position. Hmm, must be a setting accidentally changed? However after half an hour of unsetting and resetting configurations it seems that our chart card has failed — we still have charts for Northern Europe, but the micro SD card with the Canaries isn't being recognised, and also a laptop can't pick it up either.

This is why we have backups (electronic ones too, we don't need to bring out the paper and pencil yet), with detailed charts on OpenCPN on my laptop we're fine, but it's a bit annoying and not quite as accessible as having it on the boat's systems.

## 29th December – charts "borrowed"

The chart frustration above prompts us to check our other charts for later passages. So let's get them out of the chart table. They are still in the chart table, right? So why can't we find them there… hopefully the "[borrowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Borrowers)" have them, temporarily?!

Oh dear, this is not good! We have the Caribbean, the Med, and almost certainly some other charts too on cards in a small film case somewhere. We had them on the passage to the Canaries, because we had to get one out. But where they've got to now we really don't know — it's possible they've fallen foul to an over-zealous chart table clear-out, which would be a shame to say the least. And an expensive one, as these chart cards are in the region of a couple of hundred pounds each. And not easy to get hold of at short notice either — with only 1 working day before crew flying out from the UK we won't be able to source replacements, and we're not expecting many options in Tenerife, so we resign ourselves to other solutions for our trans-Atlantic navigation. How much is out there anyway?!

We have OpenCPN, and we also have some of what we need on iSailor on my iPhone, the job now is to get iSailor back up and running, with the right charts installed, on my old iPad. That'll be plenty good enough, and the extra charts we need cost less than £20 in total (10% of what we would pay for the official Navionics cards to run on the chart plotter). It takes time though…

## Next up

What new job is tomorrow going to have in store for us?!

In the meantime the bathroom isn't putting itself back together, the winches aren't servicing themselves, the dinghy cover hasn't magicked itself out of the fabric rolls we're still carrying, … !!
