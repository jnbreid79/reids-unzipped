15,577 miles since leaving France we have arrived in New Zealand…

One thing we've learned since setting out from Cherbourg almost exactly a year ago is that regularly posting timely blogs is beyond us — sorry about that!

We have so much more we would like to share, but for now, because we've arrived in New Zealand, it's time for some headlines. It's kind of cool, and feels totally crazy, to look at our track — we have to zoom out on the whole world to really appreciate it:

## Some context to the adventure

- We've sailed **15,577 miles** (72% of the earth's circumference — we are only halfway round as we didn't go in a straight line!)
- We've visited **18 countries** (or major island groups thereof, in French Polynesia and the Caribbean)
- We reached **15 knots** boat speed several times, with a max of 18.2
- We broke the **200 mile day** twice
- We stopped on passage twice for **emergency repairs** in a country we hadn't planned to visit
- We **dragged anchor** three times
- We **crashed the boat** once (the third drag)
- We took part in **three rescues at sea**
- We've met more boats and made more friends than we can remember
- We've swum with more sea life than we could have imagined
- We've had an **amazing time**…!!

## The Arrival

Our arrival into New Zealand was one we couldn't possibly have imagined. We left Tonga with a crew of five (with Paul Dugdale joining us for the passage) — these things are very official, with important documentation on our exit from the country to show for it. However, having come to the aid of the crew on a stricken yacht on the way over, we entered New Zealand with a crew of eight. Fortunately the rescue was well known by the time we arrived, and all the official bodies from NZ Maritime to customs and marina staff were ready and expecting Zipper — bringing three Kiwis home to NZ with us did no harm to our passage through the official check-in procedures!

We sailed down the Northland coastline on a beautiful morning with a glorious wind for our Code 0. There was no evidence, other than in our exhausted emotions, of the rough seas and frontal winds from the previous couple of days. This was sailing at its best (although a bit cold for us — we're not in the tropics anymore)!

## Whangarei

We're now moored in the Town Basin marina in Whangarei surrounded by a plethora of amazing cafes, bars, restaurants and supermarkets. This is taking us some getting used to after being so remote for so long — shopping in a supermarket feels overwhelming to say the least. How do you possibly choose what to buy when literally everything is available?!

We have a few more days to relax and unwind as we prepare for getting back into the routines of work and school. For now, Zipper is staying put — we won't be adding to the mileage for at least a few months…
