We're having a last beer and swim in the pool where we started off on arrival. After 2 weeks in Barbados we're checked out and ready to leave for Martinique in the early hours. It's about 100 miles, and having caught a lobster pot in the day last year we're keen to try and arrive before it gets dark, so it'll be an early start at this end.
