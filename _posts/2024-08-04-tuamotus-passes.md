Coming out of the North pass at Fakarava this morning, it felt like time to write down our experience of the various atoll passes before we forget! This one was textbook. Some of our others were far from that — but actually they were all very manageable, at no stage were we at all concerned.

## Raroia

**Entry:** Our first atoll, and our first pass. We aimed to time this one with the early morning slack but missed it by an hour or so. With an outgoing current we expected it would probably be fine — and indeed the conditions were not bad at all. There were standing waves in the middle of the outflow, but we snuck in to the North of all this — a huge advantage of our shallow draft. Smooth water, perhaps 2 knots current, nice and easy entry.

**Exit:** Again fine, with the same route out on the North side. 3 knots of current swept us out quickly, but the water was smooth and easy to navigate.

## Tahanea

**Entry:** We got to this one about 10 in the morning, a couple of hours before high water slack so we went in on the flood. Flat calm and completely benign conditions, nice and easy.

**Exit:** Our confidence was up after some easy passages, but this time it was windy. The alarm died in the night so we were late getting up — 5:30 turned into 6:30, by which time the ebb was fully underway. We had 15–20kts wind this time and the conditions in the pass were what I'd describe as rough! We crossed over to the East side seeking calmer water and snuck out very close to the reef — a little edgy, but without much more time to think about it we were already on the outside, and very glad to be there!

## Kauehi

**Entry:** The entrance to Kauehi is on the South East. With 7 miles up to the village once inside we were very tempted to sail through this pass. The flood was still running and from what we could see it looked calm — however when we got all the way round to look in at the same angle as the current runs, it was not nearly as calm as we'd thought! This time we chose the West side and crept close to the channel marker and out of the choppy water. In the end easy, but we were very glad not to be pushed in there with full sail still up!

**Exit:** We timed this perfectly with the high water slack. On our way out we spotted a dive boat mooring buoy on the outside of the pass and decided to pick it up and have a look. What a good decision! We dinghied back into the pass and drift snorkelled back out on the beginning of the ebb — this was one of the best snorkels we've had anywhere. The coral was amazing, and we saw a huge variety of fish, including some larger pelagics on the outside wall as it drops off into the abyss.

## Fakarava

**Entry:** Having taken the extra time to snorkel on the way out of Kauehi we were a little pressed for time, and the wind unkindly dropped on us — so we arrived late. We were bang on max flood, and the sun set as we were coming in. The pass itself was fine; fast but smooth incoming current. The problem was that we were going to have to anchor without any visibility of what we were dropping onto. The anchor held fine, and left it to the morning to untangle the inevitable mess — with Jamie in the water directing, the children did an amazing job helping Sophie lift the anchor. We had almost been unbelievably lucky; we missed an enormous sand patch by only 5m.

**Exit:** Finally another textbook passage — this one was our easiest. We held on while a couple of boats went out on a rough ebb, then hoisted sails before dropping the buoy. As we did so 4 ribs turned up at the pass — tour boats bringing divers — a sure sign we had timed it perfectly! We sailed out of the middle with no current or waves to speak of. A good one to finish on!

We are headed to a false pass next, on the West of Toau. After that we might stop at Makatea on our way to Tahiti — Makatea is different again, a high island with three buoys to hold you off the steep cliffs. So I think we have to hope one of them is free when we turn up!

Sad times with our visit to these wonderful atolls coming to an end. We've had an amazing time everywhere, and all have very special memories from each of the atolls.
