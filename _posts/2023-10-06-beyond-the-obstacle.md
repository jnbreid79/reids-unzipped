Advice and decisions; if we don't try we will regret it

---

> *We're at anchor in what feels like our own private coral atoll, exhausted after a day swimming and snorkelling with various coral, fish, rays, turtles, shark, … . The children are fast asleep and we are relaxing on deck, listening to the soothing sound of wavelets lapping against the side of the boat and attempting to capture how connected we feel to the natural marine world here, and what it means to us.*

Well, not yet! This is along the lines of what we hope to be writing next year; the dream that is driving the decisions we're making, and creating the (self-imposed!) worries and stresses we're now living through. We hope to be writing of course that it was all worth it, we knew it would be all along…!

Sophie and I are what we might consider 'boat people'. We're comfortable on boats and feel at home on and in the water. Our children, Isla and Angus (7&5) are too, or at least they have always demonstrated a keen interest and high level of excitement in and around the water and on boats. We have always talked about buying our own boat and living aboard. Perhaps we hadn't committed to that, but we certainly shared an expectation that one day we would make it happen.

I'm writing this on the plane to Martinique (in May); on our way to take ownership of our new home, Zipper. We are absolutely excited, but the overwhelming feeling right now is uncertainty, anxiousness and self-doubt! However years of reading the yachting press, articles and books prove that hundreds of boats head off on similar ventures every year. We are also fortunate in having several friends who have successfully trodden this path already. So, why can't we? Perhaps we're about to find out how naïve we are…!

There are two pieces of advice I've read time and again that feel particularly pertinent right now. The first has been important in getting this project underway, and the second is a realisation that this isn't as easy as we might like to think it should be:

1. **"Go smaller and go now"** — There are always reasons why next year will be better; we need to earn more money first to buy more boat. If you start using excuses you'll simply find another next year and then another the year after. We are fit and healthy now, who knows what lies around the corner? I don't think we can claim to have followed this advice properly; certainly we've taken on the "go now", but a 45ft Outremer is not exactly small in any measure — size, maintenance, bank balance… However this is what we absolutely believe to be the "right" boat, although a lot of our current worries are driven by having maxed out on boat.

2. **"The hardest part is casting off"** — I've never understood this, surely the act of leaving is actually very easy? I never thought I'd have trouble with this — however I'm now beginning to understand at least some of what people meant when they said this. There's a lot more to it than buying a boat and setting sail; the *lead up* to casting off is a long road and we're just getting started on that. Buying an EU boat post-Brexit has also introduced some additional complication, confusion and frustration!

So, what are our biggest worries, where might it all go wrong? We have a few, but the predominant ones right now are:

1. Are we being fair on the children? They will miss their friends of course. Will they go stir-crazy in a confined space for so long, either from their parents or from each other? We consider getting to know other families on route a must. In 'boat schooling' will we be able to provide them with the education they need? We certainly hope they will also come back with irreplaceable experiences, knowledge of the natural world, if not even world-wide friendships of their own.

2. Will we get over seasickness? Having grown up with a strong stomach Sophie has become prone to seasickness in motherhood. Isla has always been travel sick. What will the motion of a catamaran be like and how will we all react to that, is it something one of us won't get over? It could be a short trip after all!

3. Can we actually afford it or have we over-stretched ourselves? I might need to go back to work sooner than we'd hoped!

At the end of the day we decided we need to find out; we would always regret it if we didn't try! So, here we are…
