Wow!

We have spoken to several people about the Caribbean and their favourite place to visit. Time and again we heard people mention Tobago Cays. So we set off from Bequia for Tobago Cays — and it certainly didn't disappoint. Although the huge rainstorm and 25 knots of wind on our way over left a lot to be desired!

Tobago Cays is what everyone imagines when you talk about the Caribbean — perfect turquoise clear water with coral reefs, turtles, rays and thousands of fish. We had an incredible couple of days here and spent so much time in the water. We think it is a must for anyone visiting the windward islands.

We then headed to Union Island to check out before our sail to Bonaire. We went into Clifton where there is a brilliant bar right on the coral reef. We needed to spend the last of our EC dollars and it would have been rude not to go! It was a truly unique bar with an excellent vibe, a great spot for a sundowner before leaving the Grenadines.

We were sad not to be spending more time in the Grenadines, but we have decided that we definitely want to get through the Pacific this year, so we're heading to Panama to hopefully go through the canal at the end of the month. Next stop on the way there, Bonaire.
