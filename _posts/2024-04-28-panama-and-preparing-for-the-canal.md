After a long and hot trip to the shops for provisions in Bonaire we went to customs to check out then back to the dinghy to leave — slightly hindered by me (Sophie) falling out of the dinghy as we left the dock, much to everyone's amusement! Luckily it's the cleanest dinghy dock we've been to so far. Once the team had successfully rescued the MOB we headed back to Zipper, had a quick lunch and set sail.

The trip round the corner of Colombia and into Panama can be notoriously windy with big seas, so we had stayed an extra few days in Bonaire hoping to avoid 40 knots of wind. We made a very good decision — a great downwind sail with relatively benign seas and 25 knots max of wind, mostly less, which dropped as we neared Panama.

## Emergency at the Mast

A couple of days into the trip, while at the mast, Jamie noticed the goose neck pin had become undone and was coming out. If this had come out completely we would have had an absolute disaster — the pin in the gooseneck keeps the boom attached to the mast. We told the children we'd be doing an urgent job and needed them to stay in the cockpit. Engines on, up into the wind, main dropped.

Through sheer luck and determination — and a combination of tool and rope systems to create leverage, after what seemed like way too long — the pin slid back into place. We screwed it in place and tied it in for good measure! The children were once again brilliant.

## Arrival and Shelter Bay

Unfortunately our habit of arriving in the dark is still with us. We stayed in a small anchorage a few miles short of Colon, where our main came down unexpectedly and deposited itself all over Jamie and the starboard side of the boat. Arriving in the dark is bad enough, but with added excitement it's really no fun.

The next morning revealed a beautiful anchorage — clear water, beaches, reefs and jungle surrounding us. We jumped in the water and spent a painstaking couple of hours cleaning the hull (needed for the Galapagos certificate) then headed to Shelter Bay Marina for final preparations.

Flying through a raft of huge container ships on the way to the breakwater at 8 or 9 knots was an awesome sight. We counted over 30 container ships at anchor outside the breakwater.

## Provisioning for the Pacific

Shelter Bay marina has great facilities. The marina lays on a bus to the shops every day — we got the 8am bus on Thursday and ended up with a full 3 trolleys worth of provisions! The supermarket offered to drive us back, which was just as well as the heavens had opened.

## The Crew

We needed four line handlers for the canal. We knew Bumpy (Jamie's father, Nigel) was flying out, but needed two more. A chance conversation with Dottie & Grumpy proved very beneficial — we found another line handler in the form of their good friend Paul, who despite only flying home from the UK to Boston on Thursday, was keen to fly straight to Panamá to come through the canal with us.

Bumpy arrived on Saturday morning to much excitement from us all — and a pause in the rain! It was so good to see him strolling down the pontoon. The children screamed with excitement and ran to him. Not only were they seeing Bumpy for the first time in months, he also came bearing many, many gifts. His arrival marked the start of the next phase of our adventure.

This was it — crewed up and ready for the final preparations to transit the canal.
