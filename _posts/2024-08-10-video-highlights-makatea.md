Some highlights of our stay in Makatea — exploring the island with Tapu.

We took a tour with Tapu, an energetic and passionate guy working hard to bring more tourism to Makatea. Son of the mayor, Julien, Tapu has worked in events in Tahiti for several years before returning to the island. He is working on all sorts of initiatives, including setting up a mountain climbing business (the perfect location for it!) and organising festivals on the island. We loved the day we spent with him being shown around — absolutely recommended!
