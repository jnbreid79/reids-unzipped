Our autopilot developed a grinding noise in the days after leaving Tenerife. With nearly 2,500 miles still to sail we decided to stop in the Cape Verdes to get it looked at…

Our beautiful 4 day sail out of Tenerife was finally ended by dying breeze, and we motored all of the last 36 hours into Mindelo, on Sao Vicente.

There is an anchorage in Mindelo immediately beside the marina, so we chose a spot on the shoreside away from the larger traffic and ferries. We went ashore to explore the town, landing on the dinghy dock, but in relatively short order (on Friday evening, keen to find somewhere quickly with the children rather than wander around aimlessly) ended up back at the marina's floating bar. Setting up with a live band this was great fun, and the bar has a lovely aspect looking out into the harbour so you can watch the comings and goings. With a big Bali being delivered by (also quite big) Irishman (really a Scotsman) Andy, who we had met berthing next to in Santa Cruz, arriving just as we were about to leave the bar we felt obliged to stay a little longer after he immediately bought us all a round. Some of us woke up with pretty sore heads in the morning!

We were anchored in prime position for watching the small local fishing boats coming in and out of the beach, where their catch is immediately prepared in the shallows, and put into the adjacent fish market (and the neighbouring street). Fresh although some of it undoubtedly is, there is nothing like a pungent fish smell in the street to stop you even thinking about buying any fish there!

A large fishing boat on Sunday morning made it clear that we were anchored too close to their manoeuvring area, so we upped anchor and moved closer to the marina, further towards the small boat fishing beach. Everything in Mindelo seems to happen at full volume, certainly on the boats — there was much gesticulating and shouting. We didn't take any of this personally, as that just seems to be the way of things. Everyone on the local boats are shouting all the time, either to each other over the noise of their outboard, or to someone else presumably at the other end of the phone. They are also mostly standing up, we saw dozens of relatively heavily laden small boats going to and fro, which we guessed was some kind of local ferry service, all standing up holding onto various painters and other ropes. The fishing boats were the same; maybe their gunwales and thwarts are particularly uncomfortable or wet?!

The disparity in wealth here is stark. Leaving the marina entrance was a bit like running the gauntlet, trying not to get accosted by a mixture of would-be tour guides, taxi drivers and others who simply would do anything, even take your rubbish, to get some money. The African market was interesting, from masses of fruit and veg stalls, and clothing (very African in bright colours), to all sorts of random second hand electrical and other goods that almost certainly didn't even work, giving it a distinctly car-boot-sale feel. One guy followed us with a Cape Verde football strip for Angus, which actually looked pretty good — so Julia went back later in the week to get it for him, and a dress for Isla. He was very friendly, I had a broken English discussion about the Senegal football team and their disappointment in losing to England at the World Cup! In fact they really were all very friendly.

The marina is busy with yachts continually coming and going, and the atmosphere on the pontoons is wonderfully supportive. Pretty much everyone here is leaving to cross the Atlantic next, so the preparation and ongoing passage is a continual discussion on the pontoons and in the bar. Every boat leaving gets a proper fanfare send-off with horns and shouted well-wishes from everyone else.

Monday finally dawned for us, and with it two particularly important tasks that we'd had to wait over the weekend for; 1 — we had to check into Cape Verde officially, and 2 — we had to try and find someone at the yard (BoatCV) who could help us. So we divided and Rob went with our papers and passports to check in, and I went to the boatyard. They have a floating office on the pontoon, however having been shut over the weekend it was particularly busy on Monday morning — a whole rally had arrived at about the same time as us, the Viking Explorers, and it seemed they were ahead of me in the queue. Unfortunately although I had contacted them on route I hadn't been able (over the Iridium sat phone) to fill in the online application form, whereas all those with Starlink (and a lot of boats here do have Starlink) don't have those kind of old-world problems! Having said that, it was night and day different to the wait we had in the Canaries; there, we were told in early December that we had to wait until end of Jan for anyone to come and have a look at us — whereas here we had someone onboard on the Monday evening, same-day! We moved into the marina as they wouldn't come onto the boat at anchor unfortunately, it's not the cheapest, and with the surge I definitely slept more soundly at anchor. From there we had a frustrating week of waiting, not sure whether our man Gilson was coming in the next hour or not at all until next week. Had we known we had a few days 'free' we could have made more of the time and gone further afield on the island, however being available to get the boat fixed up and not miss them was the priority so we largely stayed put.

Having said that we didn't rest on our laurels; a mixture of necessary jobs — refuelling, filling the gas tanks we couldn't get filled in the Canaries (yep, they did them both for us here, and cheap) hair cuts, school and reprovisioning, to the very important things such as enthusiastic gingerbread-men-making, learning to play draughts, and simply relaxing (some more aggressively than others) in the hammock (thanks Judy, invaluable piece of equipment #1!).

The problem was quickly identified as broken springs inside the autopilot. The solution for which was new springs, so they set off to the local market to find the closest thing they could. The first attempt ended in failure, as the new springs simply broke again immediately, so they had to return again the next day for a further search. The second set they found has proven altogether more successful and we hope will have a long and healthy life! This took a few days out of our schedule and by now it was Saturday (with Monday bank holiday to come). Gilson however was adamant we should be on our way, so he came to work on Saturday for what he thought would be a couple of hours. At 9pm, after hours of flushing hydraulic fluid from temporary large header tanks (made of 1.5L water bottles) of which I'm sure we will all have nightmares for years to come, with pizza and beers kindly supplied by Rob and Julia, Gilson and his colleague volunteered to come back again on Sunday to finish the job. He didn't want his Saturday's work to go to waste with us still not ready to leave. It turns out we had other problems in the electrical system, the Raymarine steering sensor had also been broken, and when calibrating on Sunday we found out that the port rudder was not aligned with the steering arm. This would almost certainly have been the root cause of the autopilot and sensor failures. So now we had a reason for the failure, and therefore more confidence that the fix was going to work. Rudders realigned, manually from in the water (I definitely got the short straw, the marina water is not the cleanest!), and a few more hours' work on Sunday, we were finally good to go! What an effort, Gilson certainly went way above and beyond for us for which we were and are extremely grateful; with a great restaurant recommendation to boot for our last evening.

Although we've now been to the Cape Verdes, we feel like we haven't seen anything of the Cape Verdes themselves. Mindelo is a busy port town, it's certainly not the prettiest, but with the friendliness of the people we met it is somewhere we would not hesitate to return to and explore properly given more time and/or a boat which doesn't need fixing up!
