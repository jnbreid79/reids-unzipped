A couple of days in the false pass at Anse Amyot on the NW of Toau. This was our last atoll in the Tuamotus — and it did not disappoint.

After sailing through Fakarava North Pass, we headed for the corner of Toau to sail around to the North West where there is a false pass. This is a protected lagoon, where a wonderful family lives and 10 buoys are laid for cruisers.

After a slightly damp start the clouds dispersed and we had a perfect downwind sail under main and jib, up the side of the atoll and round the top. We were slightly concerned that Anse Amyot would be full, with only 10 buoys and limited anchoring space, so we had begun thinking of contingency plans. On arrival, however, we found the last free mooring buoy — relief!

## Gaston and Valentine

After taking up the buoy, we put the dinghy in the water and headed ashore to say hello to Gaston and Valentine. They gave us a warm welcome and invited us to look around — they have lots of animals and the children were particularly taken with the little piglets that came running up as we approached the pig pen.

Valentine speaks wonderful English and told us where to snorkel and dive. We went back the following day and ordered cooked lobster — it was the same price whether Gaston cooked it or not, so we decided to have him cook it on his BBQ. A great decision; the lobster was fantastic!

## Spearfishing

Valentine told us that in 60 years they had never had ciguatera, but they ate the parrot fish and never grouper or snapper. They were very happy for us to try and catch our own. Jamie has been eager to try out the spear gun so it seemed an opportunity not to miss. After a few warm-up shots, the hunter gatherer returned to Zipper with parrot fish for supper! They are beautiful fish and unlike others retain their colour when they die. They have a very delicate white flesh and are absolutely delicious.

## The Outside Wall

We had a couple of great snorkels and an astonishing dive off the outside wall — a sheer drop off into the abyss. We went to the Yellow Dog dive site recommended by Valentine. It was our first dive together and we both loved it, even if it was a little edgy — half a mile up the coast outside the atoll, in strong current, very much on our own (we did take our handheld VHF just in case!).

Because of the limited mooring balls and the communal area created by Valentine and Gaston, Anse Amyot is a very friendly and sociable place to visit. We met a French family who had spent 15 months cruising four years ago and had decided to charter a catamaran to revisit some of their favourite places. It seems Anse Amyot has a certain charm that draws people back.

We really enjoyed our time here and highly recommend it to anyone in the Tuamotus.
