Working through the jobs list in the yard…

It's been a busy couple of weeks of boat work in Marin. We decided to take the opportunity whilst we're here, with the excellent facilities, to fix up all the issues and niggles we've encountered.

This included lifting the boat out for a few days:

It's very frustrating that we had to do this at all, but she needs to come out to get the rudders off. When they were built new for us the rudder posts weren't fitted with the ability to attach the emergency steering. In our opinion this should have been done at the time, however we also should have noticed it too, but we didn't for one reason and another (new boat to us, learning about everything else) until we were suffering other steering issues in the Atlantic and worrying about the hydraulics. That's when we realised we had no other viable alternative — not ideal! So, time to resolve that. And whilst she's out also replace the saildrive seals that are both falling off (again — this is annoying as they too were fitted new in France), as well as fit the second new escape hatch. This one is lower than the one we replaced in St. Malo, changing is a nice-to-have rather than a necessity, having bought the hatch in France it's been ready to go on next time we lifted. So really 2 jobs that are fixing up work finished 5 months ago in France.

We then decided at the last minute, after discussion with the yard, to raise the waterline by an inch and a half. We've been toiling trying to keep the waterline clean and are starting to damage the gelcoat. So, tape on and sand — doesn't sound that tricky but 45ft down both sides of 2 hulls is nearly 200ft of waterline! So that took a day, and the yard took on the painting so we could spend Angus' birthday with him. We didn't get the blue colour right, but no matter as it's well under the water and not noticeable afloat:

Photos of the saildrive seals, and we also had a look into the starboard prop as we had (a little) seawater in the saildrive oil:

The other two jobs we wanted help with were to fix the biggest concerns we had on passage across the Atlantic:

1. The mast — we had noticed movement and wear at the foot of the mast on our way across the Atlantic, this has been worrying us
2. Hydraulics, more hydraulic concerns (fortunately not the autopilot this time, that is now behaving perfectly and silently 👍) with the fluid levels in header tanks above each steering wheel going up and down by more than the height of each tank — i.e. alternately emptying and overflowing. To ensure we didn't get air into the system on either side we spent a lot of the passage moving fluid from one tank to the other, and vice versa (with Calpol syringes — as well as being perfect for measuring epoxy parts they really are useful!). We have been unable to get any confirmation as to whether we should expect the levels to change when sailing, or whether this did indeed pose a risk.

One header tank empty and the other full to overflow

Mast panting and dust from foot plate wearing (when flying gennaker):

The mast came out a few days before we lifted (you may have noticed the mast missing from the lift pictures above):

Without a mast, we pretended we were a motorboat for a weekend — it felt very strange out in the anchorage without a mast!

The profile of the mast foot is far from ideal, with 4 very small areas of contact between the foot and the oval mast profile:

Time for some more welding then; we now have some nice new plates to sit along the inner sidewalls of the mast, and they've cut the bottom centimetre off the mast to remove the cracks and badly worn areas:

And we're nearly done — we are back in the water now but still motorboating:

The mast is scheduled to go back up at lunch tomorrow — what more could Sophie hope for as her 40th birthday present?!

Today's good news was the thumbs up from the hydraulic expert here; we will now sail and simply let the fluid move between tanks without fretting or interfering, it seems that moving backwards and forwards is just what the fluid does on the (rare) two-wheel setup we have. As long as we don't lose it from both tanks…!

In the meantime we've been servicing our engines, but that's a story for another post…
