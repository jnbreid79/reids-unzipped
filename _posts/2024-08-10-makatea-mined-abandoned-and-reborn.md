excerpt: "A small island between Tahiti and the Tuamotus, Makatea is unlike anywhere else — pushed up from the ocean, mined for phosphate, and now quietly coming back to life."

Makatea is a unique world. A small island between Tahiti and the Tuamotus, it is only 4 miles across. The nearest Tuamotu, Rangiroa, lies 40 miles to the North.

But Makatea is not "just another Tuamotu." Opposing the trend of everything else here, where volcanically formed islands sink to become atolls, this is an atoll that has been pushed up out of the ocean. The coral platform that used to reside on the surface is now nearly 100m up in the sky, bounded by the same sheer cliffs that are a feature of the sharp underwater drop-offs that surround the atolls themselves.

## The Past

Coral sand dried out over a million years has become phosphate — and that is what the island was mined for between 1906 and 1966. The phosphate here is very pure, perhaps the highest quality phosphate in the world, and therefore sought after for agriculture by all nations. Exports went all around the world including France, the US, China and Japan.

To set up an operation of 3,000 to 4,000 people on a remote island requires the installation of every facet of life for the workers. They needed a power station, bakery, butchers, cinema, theatre — the island had to become somewhere with facilities for everyday life. So there were jobs for all, not just engineers and miners, and these people were brought to the island too. Apparently at its peak the island had 30 football teams!

## The Present

Mining stopped in 1966 and most of the workers left. However when a government or company decides to stop work, there is no incentive to spend any time or money decommissioning — so pretty much everything remains. The industrial machinery, railways and port structure are all sitting here rusting away. It really is extraordinary to see and imagine what it was like — the island has a population of just 60 today!

The landscape is harsh — although relatively flat at scale, the dried coral is sharp and pitted. And the mining pits are not a foot or two deep; some are 50m deep yet barely 5m across. When the miners started digging a new hole the instruction was simple: keep digging until you can't dig any further.

The sand was loaded into wheelbarrows, pushed to the nearest railroad, and then a funicular dropped the material off the high plateau down to sea level. The foundations of a huge swinging crane still stand on the edge of the reef. On approach we thought at first it looked like a huge shipwreck, or an enormous cannon — but of course it is neither!

## The Future

Makatea is being reborn. Since moorings were installed in 2018 this has become a magical place to stop for a self-sufficient cruiser. Few cruising here before then would even have known it existed. There are no restaurants or bars, and only a couple of very small shops supplied by boat once a month.

Tapu, the mayor's son, takes tourists on half-day island tours — this is what we did, and we can't recommend it highly enough. He is passionate, knowledgeable, energetic and fun. He has started setting up a rock climbing operation with three sites already and hundreds of routes for all levels — we reckon it has the potential to become a world-class climbing destination.

> It's the kind of place where you wonder whether you're seeing the "before it got famous" moment — and hope it stays just like this a little longer.
