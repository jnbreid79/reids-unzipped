excerpt: "Visiting Tearavero and a few days relaxing on a secluded motu in the East of Kauehi — shell beaches, hermit crabs, bonfires, and a perfect drift snorkel out of the pass."

We left Tahanea early in the morning in company with several other boats who had been waiting for the weather. We were heading for the South pass at Fakarava, however the wind angle made a trip instead up to Kauehi look much more attractive — so we headed there instead. A great day sail and easy entrance got us anchored off the town in plenty of time before dark.

## Tearavero

Tearavero, although one of the larger towns in the Tuamotus, is a relatively small settlement and is beginning to feel a little run down. With the closure of some local pearl farms there is less investment here now. Nevertheless the locals we met were all friendly and welcoming, as we've grown to expect in French Polynesia.

We found Magasin Yip, one of three small grocery stores, which had some beautiful handmade jewellery at the back — all shells and pearls local to the area. Because the supply ship had been in yesterday they had just sent most of the jewellery to Tahiti to be sold, but there was still some stunning work on display — extremely intricate and delicate shell work. A few months late perhaps, but this was the perfect opportunity to get Sophie a 40th birthday present!

## The Motu

After visiting the village we headed to the far East of the atoll and found the most idyllic anchorage — just off a motu, on a shell beach. You could spend hours sorting and picking out tiny delicate shells, each seemingly more beautiful than the last. It turned out the beach was also a hermit crab nursery. It was extraordinary — when you sat still you suddenly noticed that the whole beach was alive and moving, even the tiniest shells were inhabited!

We had a bonfire ashore and a supper of sausages and marshmallows, with a stunning sunset and a location almost all to ourselves.

After a couple of days of enjoying the remoteness — kitesurfing, slacklining, swimming and generally playing on the beach and in the shallows — it was time to head to Fakarava.

## The Pass

As we headed through the pass (which was lovely and calm) we spotted a buoy outside the reef in the perfect location — we picked it up and jumped in. We dinghied back into the atoll and drifted back out through the pass on the beginning of the ebb.

It was a fabulous snorkel with lots of coral and fish. As we came round the edge of the pass there was a stunning wall with big fish and sharks everywhere, the larger pelagic fish waiting on the outside near the drop-off. And we drifted all the way back round the corner directly to Zipper — the dive companies know where to put their buoys!

A perfect end to a wonderful few days in Kauehi — we happily jumped back onboard and hoisted the sails to head off with great anticipation for Fakarava.
